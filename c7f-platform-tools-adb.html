Good morning staff, I'm here with a question I needed a little help with android studio. I recently upgraded to version 3.1.2, and I have a problem that is as follows: I've created quite a few AVDs, and they all run without any problem, the bad thing is that when I run my app to select the emulator that I want none of those I created or create later appears in that window. I've already forced the program to run with an emulator already created, and once again it runs the emulator sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-26" Это команда установит platform tools (включая adb и fastboot) и инструменты SDK для API 26, что соответствует Android версии.

Hi, I want to try side loading apps (ALVR and Pavlov to be exact) but I've been unable to detect the Quest while using ADB Devices. I've followed all the steps. 1. Created an organization 2. Enabled Developer Mode on the app 3. Installed 15 second ADB and normal platform-tools ADB on the desktop 4. Run CMD using Administrator rights No matter what I do, when I connect the Quest to my PC and type ADB Devices, the list of devices is empty. It's probably coz the prompt to enable debugging credits to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbRIWfaClE tyco tech, who is the MAN. but instead of having to download those batch files, which are windows only and dependent on file path, you could just do it yourself :) prerequisites: - create an oculus dev account - enable developer mode for your quest via your oculus app on your phone - get scrcpy: # easy dependencies if you have homebrew, otherwise see scrcpy readme brew install scrcpy brew cask install platform-too. I had been facing delayed notifications on my OP6. After following this guide: https://old.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/9vyg7a/psa\_notification\_fix\_works\_100/ (https://old.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/9vyg7a/psa_notification_fix_works_100/) I was able to temporarily halt it for a week. However, now these commands do not seem to work. My phone continues to go into Doze mode 10-15 min after OP6 goes into sleep. Every other setting related to Battery Optimization has been turned I've been using the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro (M1), the 6 GB RAM variant for a little over a week now. Mostly very satisfied. Compared a lot with a Redmi Note 5 Pro that a friend owns. This phone excels in almost everything but the camera. The camera is no slouch tho. Very decent. I also enabled the Camera2 API via a fastboot (yes, without root) and Google Camera performance is just awesome. I'll post camera samples if anyone wants to see it. The battery performance is not that great
