What's your experience of the Unity engine creating an immersive gameplay experience. And its great. The game now reminds me of Temple of Elemental evil strategic greatness. Its simply fantastic. If you love turn based The game is on sale right now for .99 on Fanatical (https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire). I paid full price for this at launch, and coming from someone who is a big fan of games like Baldur's Gate, it did not disappoint even a little bit. There are 11 classes to pick from, and you can combine any two of those together to make a unique build. This makes for very high replayability. There are 5 difficulty settings so anyone can feel comfortable jumping right. 
So this is something that I noted after experiencing Pillars 2 as both an Aedyrian, Old Vailian, and Rauatai, character. Despite having settled in the Dyrwood and ruled there for several years the Warcher is unable to choose their background as a Dyrwoodian. Dyrwoodite? This. is something I find to be a tad bit disappointing in hindsight but I don’t hold it against Obsidian for not including it. That said if they HAD chosen to include a Dyrwoodian background how would y’all I am currently playing thru the original Pillars of Eternity as my first experience with a top down RPG featuring real time party combat with pausing. The real time combat is hard for me to get used to so I'm dying a lot and reloading saves to fix mistakes but I am enjoying the story/characters and getting a little more comfortable with combat. I love RPGs and as a new DampD player I have been really enjoying immersing myself in this fantasy settings. I guess I've got a two part question. Hi I am looking for Pillars of Eternity 2. Don't PM, Comment first. I am in the Africa Region. I have enough money to buy one of these two games. Which do you think would provide me the best role-playing experience? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts. Is that normal? If I just started the game I get 55-60 FPS in Nekataka, then after a while I notice I'm down to 40 FPS in the same area. Similar thing happened with the game Squad - I had to restart the game after a match otherwise it would have less FPS, so maybe One year after the game has been released and the game still performs poorly? These aren't cutting edge graphics. Anyone has general tips on how to improve performance? I'm playing on High with a computer that should handle High but doesn't. Even a ship boarding battle is insatisfactory. Hi everyone, I wanted to know if there is a place where I can find the illustrations that are displayed when you have the story choices, did anyone made a compilation of them? Thank you! example here: https://techraptor.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review-07.png (https://techraptor.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review-07.png). This one showed up a month ago but I just was able to order it for .93. I haven't been able to pick it up yet so we will see if there are any errors. Its listed as 16.26 on https://www.walmart.com/ip/THQ-Nordic-Pillars-of-Eternity-II-Deadfire-PC/640065776 (https://www.walmart.com/ip/THQ-Nordic-Pillars-of-Eternity-II-Deadfire-PC/640065776) but when in stock shows up as .93. amp#x200B; Good luck and I hope I can go grab mine tomorrow. The text adventure portions of Pillars 2 are amazing. Specifically how you can use unique skills, spells, and items to pass obstacles. My ranger tamed a drake and commanded it to fight other creatures for me. Any other RPGs out there come close to this unique sort of text adventure? I know Pathfinder Kingmaker has text adventure portions, but are they as deep as this one? Was Pillars 2 the first
