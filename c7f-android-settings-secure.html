                            <p> hI i don't find a tutorial for setting up a yubikey nf5 on Android (sansung galaxy s8) without adaptater. Installed nova and removed pixel launcher because I like navigation buttons. Is there anyway to swap the back and recent app icons to the opposite sides. 
So my Samsung Galaxy smartphone has a feature i recently found called lockdown mode. I don't know how long it's been there but it seems to be very useful. When you press the button, the biometrics are disabled, notifications are automatically cleared and smart lock is disabled. This feature could be useful when approached by the police in the US or if other people are attempting to access your device. This is what the button looks like: https://imgur.com/a/aUtgFUZ. Hello, is it possible to grant android.permission.WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS with ADB? I got this error: Operation not allowed: java.lang.SecurityException: Package ltpackagenamegt has not requested permission android.permission.WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS Thanks and regards. For those who moved to android, what can be done to minimize google tracking your data? Is it possible at all? IOS doesnt even give you a choice in device or usage which makes it hard to acccept. Thanks. I got the DNS manager app with dnscrypt but it has every dns but cloudflare. Can anyone help? Solved : in dns manager app you need to put a custom dns (1.1.1.1). I can’t get my Samsung S7 to disable lock screen when I’m home. I tried the inbuilt android location based smart lock setting. But most of the times this doesn’t work well. Then I wanted to try with Tasker. I have followed guides on YouTube made by joaoapps I think. I have installed Auto Tools. But whenever the screen is turned off, I’m asked to use fingerprint or my 4 digit code to unlock. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong? Can someone please I thought it would be useful if there was a post online outlining the steps for individuals with no programming experience to give permission using Mac OS X. amp#x200B; There's a lot of tutorials online, though most are outdated and don't explain the end to end process specifically for Tasker, indeed the official process (https://joaoapps.com/AutoApps/Help/Info/com.joaomgcd.autotools/com.joaomgcd.autotools.activity.ActivityConfigsettings.html) doesn't work for me - in that "3)" links. I posted about on r/ protonmail about this but they were very dismississive. The Protonmail setting to prevent the Android App Manager or other apps from taking screenshots of your open decrypted email while you are reading it is disabled by default and resets itself back to off every time you log out. In other words, everytime you log into Protonmail, screenshots are enabled. It seems obvious that in an app that manages secure encrypted email, screenshots should be disabled by default right?. 
Every time phone reboots, we must enter password once. I want to disable that mandatory password entry and directly unlock phone using my fingerprint. Hey guys, A while back, I made a Tasker task called Location Toggle. It uses the AutoTools Secure Settings plugin, and basically did the following. Reads location settings - If zero (location disabled), sets it to High Accuracy which enables it If not disabled, disables it. This used to work great several months back. If I was having GPS issues, I could really quickly run the task twice, faster than going into GPS settings and manually turning it off and back on - and furthermore, it would. Had to make a new topic since https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongodev/comments/6554k1/tutorial_set_your_android_phone_to_a_lower/ seems archived. I am not able to run the adb shell command `wm size 720x1280` or the `wm density` command that are instructed in above URL. I actually did manage to do it earlier on this same phone (Xiaomi Redmi note 3+) but since I updated my MIUI to 9 recently, I can't do it. I have enabled developer tools and the debugging options in there, I wonder if there I bought a Verizon Note 4 sm-n910v off ebay recently off ebay. I saw in the description that it was rooted but I didn't think much of that, I really bought it because it was in good condition and was a decent price. Today I was about to put in my SIM and activate the note 4 when it occurred to me that I might be taking a huge security risk. I booted to recovery mode to see what kind of options I had for wiping old data/permissions and it booted in to TWRP, an application I've never used before. I mean, if the internal and SD are encrypted, what is the risk of not enforcing that the password be entered before the OS boots up? Seems that since the pin number for locking and encryption are the same, and if the phone is on and locked someone cannot get in, is it just an option to have it since it's possible? Or is the secure startup crucially important for some reasons I am unaware. Hey guys, since I am now using a Huawei Mate 20 Pro I find out that there is no way to automatically activate the speakerphone on a call. It was possible with my Galaxy S7 edge. Does anyone know something about. WARNING FROM OP: This will actually completely disable your Android phone and can't be fixed at the local store for your provider. Only the technical support service staff hotline for your provider can undo this. Your phone's data will not be erased Is there a way to get Tasker to perform an action when a fingerprint is not recognized? I tried Secure Settings with "failed login" with no luck. Thank. It's now possible to remove status bar icons with Tasker. Here's a tutorial. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkCSwc6HKvc) So how can we figure out the names of the status bar icons? The only ones I know are listed in the tutorial above. There are a lot that I would like to remove, such as: - Mail notification icons - Carrier name - Change keyboard icon If you know any ways of checking or any status bar icon names, please share 
I'm posting this because I know a lot of people don't like using lockscreens or prefer to use the insecure swipe lockscreen. This will essentially activate a secure lockscreen whenever you have the Android Pay application open, so it won't prompt you to set up a lockscreen, but the lockscreen will be disabled once you leave the Android Pay app. 1. Set a lockscreen using Android Pay or the system settings. If you're not rooted, use a PIN or password lockscreen. If you're rooted, use whatever. Android has a built-in feature called Smart Lock which is supposed to keep your device unlocked while it's in a specified area (such as home). Sounds great in theory, but in practice it is very unreliable. It is so dodgy I actually prefer the convenience of have my phone entirely unlocked, but that is obviously not ideal when I leave the house. Is it possible to make something similar with Tasker? I actually used to have a perfectly working setup with Tasker and the Secure Settings plug-in So I'm still anxiously awaiting the arrival of Messages for Web on my phone, and I was curious, if anyone who has already received it, do your third party texting services allow you to use it? Can Textra still be my default messaging app while I'm using the web service? Or will I be forced to use Google messages? Thanks. Is it safe enough to use for doing online banking and other things that use sensitive information? Also, can it become infected by visiting unsafe websites or clicking on the wrong things. Used to have a 6s plus and made the move to android after the praise of this phone in reviews and the latest iOS update trashing my phone and making it near unusable. I've heard all sorts about the navbar and stuff I should tweak? but I am an android noob and want to know what I should get to make the most out of my new android experience.
